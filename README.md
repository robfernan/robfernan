## 🚀 About Me

Software engineer building full-stack applications, embedded systems, and retro hardware projects. BS Engineering (CS concentration). I specialize in aerospace software, low-level programming, and creative technology—shipping production code across desktop, web, mobile, and classic gaming platforms.

## 🏆 Featured Work

**Production Software**
- **[AviationPro](https://github.com/robfernan/AviationPro)** — Professional flight planning suite for pilots. React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS. Real tool used for pre-flight operations.
- **[Nero.js](https://github.com/robfernan/nero-js)** — Universal JavaScript framework for cross-platform development. Write once, deploy to PS2, PSP, PS3, Web, Desktop, and Mobile.

**Games & Creative Projects**

- **Retro Console Development** — PSP, PS1, PS2, Game Boy homebrew and low-level programming.
- **Games & Interactive Media** — Love2D, Unity, Godot, custom engines. Pixel art, game mechanics, and atmospheric design.
- **Aerospace Software** — Flight planning, navigation tools, and pilot-focused applications.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages:** C++, C, Lua, JavaScript, TypeScript, MIPS Assembly, HTML, CSS

**Frameworks & Engines:** SFML, OpenGL, Love2D, SDL2, React, Unity, Godot, Defold, Bevy

**Platforms:** PSP, PS1, PS2, Game Boy, Arduino, MSP430, Raspberry Pi, Android, Linux, Windows, macOS

## 🎯 Current Focus

- **Nero.js** — Building a unified JavaScript/TypeScript framework for retro console development. Currently supporting PS2 via AthenaEnv.js, with PS1, PSP, and PS3 support in progress. Goal: Make console development as simple as web development.
- **Hopeless Catch** — Expanding the game release to Web (React), Desktop (NW.js), and Mobile (Capacitor) for cross-platform availability and allowing further updates of the game.
- ***PaperWorks** — Document creation and PDF editing suite with business cards, resumes, invoices, and advanced PDF tools. Web version complete. Expanding to Desktop (NW.js) and Mobile (Capacitor).
